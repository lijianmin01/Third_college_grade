The objective of this study is to to predict the contraceptive methods (no use, long-term methods,or shortterm methods) of a woman based on her demographic and socio-economic characteristics. A data-set of 1473 married women with their demographic and socio-economic characteristics used in this study. The Source for the data-set is the UCI Machine Learning Repository at, http://http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Contraceptive+Method+Choice [?]. This study consists with two phases. Objective of the Phase I is to preprocess and explore the data-set in order to build the model in Phase II. All the activities have been performed in Python package in this study and Compiled from Jupyter Notebook This report covers both narratives and the Python codesudes for the data preprocessing and exploration which performed under the phase I. Content of this report is organized as follows. Section 1 describes the data sets and their attributes. Section 2 covers data preprocessing. In Section 3, each attribute and their inter-relationships are explored.
